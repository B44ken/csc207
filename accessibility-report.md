_1. For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-3 sentences — or point form notes — explaining which features of your program adhere to that principle._
- **Equitable use**: One feature that we could implement in the future that would adhere to the principle of Equitable use is implementing screen readers for our UI.
Currently our program is not accessible for the visually impaired demographic, as we don’t utilize audio outputs such as notifications or audio popups
We agreed that a possible implementation would be a Screen Reader/Text-to-speech API that could read aloud content present on the screen, when the UI switches views etc.
- **Flexibility in use**: 

- **Tolerance for Error:** we included multiple success and failure pop ups to inform users when a wrong type of input was attempted to be added
future implementation we considered include delete and edit  based on open closed principles
- **Low Physical Effort:** We have no unnecessary buttons nor clicks.
We have shortcuts for all “major” screens at the bottom of our UI, including “Home” “Income” “Expense” “Goals”
- **Size and Space for Approach and Use:**
Provide enough space for reach, manipulation, and use, regardless of the user's mobility. In virtual environments, ensure scalable elements and responsive design.

_2. Write a paragraph (3-6 sentences) about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your program to customers._

- We would market our program towards students. When we were first planning the design for our program, we designed all of our use cases from the perspective of our own experiences as undergraduate students. 
For example, add_goal was implemented with encouraging students to set practical goals, add_budget was to set a baseline for healthy financial habits, and get_insight use cases that provide financial resources specific to UofT students (e.g. scholarships).

_3. Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics._
- Our program is likely to be used by students, as mentioned above, but after discussion we also concluded that the elderly should be likely.
